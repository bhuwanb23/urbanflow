<h1>UrbanFlow</h1>

<h2>Objective:</h2>

Our project revoloves around addressing the concerns of reducing the ecological footprints created by humanity by promoting the idea of muilti-modal transportation system that largely emphasis on the use of public transportation system .
The application helps the user to reach their destination on time based on their empahsis on cost/time tradeoff 

<h2>Features of the application: </h2> 

- <b>Efficincy: </b>Ensures that the user reaches the destination on time with minimal waiting time in between.
- <b>User Personilazation: </b>Provides personalised routings curated to the need of the user (i.e) multiple ways to reach a destination.
- <b>Analytics: </b>Utilizes AI and predictive analytics to make informed route suggestions, enhancing trip planning.
- <b>Integration: </b>Combines public-transit as well as micro-mobility options offering the user multi-modal choices that have been seamlessly integrated into a single platform
- <b>Models: </b>uses models like  nueral nets like LSTM  that helps to give an accurate preidction of the traffic based data available in correspondence to a particular location

  <h3>An example of how user personalisation works:</h3>

  There are differnt methods to achieve the destination and the users have also been provided with the perspective of teh routes made avalable to them
